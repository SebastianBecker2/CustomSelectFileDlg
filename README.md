CustomSelectFileDlg is a .Net WinForms dialog that allows you to specify the content yourself.<br>
Regular OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog show files and folders from the local filesystems.<br>With CustomSelectFileDlg, you can create your own filesystem or show the filesystem of another machine or display anything that has a filesystem-like hierarchy.<br>
CustomSelectFileDlg tries to imitate the style and usability of the standard Windows OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog.<br>Additionally it supports folder selection, similar to the CommonOpenFileDialog from Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Dialogs.

The amazing [FatCow IconPack](https://www.fatcow.com/free-icons) is used.
